description: Lead a team of DeepSeek V4.1 worker agents. You plan, delegate and review; headless DeepSeek-powered Claude Code workers do well-scoped subtasks (exploring code, mechanical edits, tests, drafts). Use when the user asks for DeepSeek workers, when they run /deepseek-agents, and whenever the project's AGENTS.md sets a DeepSeek delegation level of 2 or more.

# DeepSeek worker agents

You are the lead. Each worker is a separate headless Claude Code process running on DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (`deepseek-flash`) through DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible API, started by `ds-agent.ps1` in this skill's folder. A worker sees only the brief you write (not this conversation, not the user's Claude login) and returns one final report. Workers are cheaper than you but less reliable: you own the plan, the integration and the final quality.

Claude Code's built-in Agent tool can't do this, because its subagents always use your provider. For DeepSeek work, use this script, not the Agent tool.

## When to delegate

Good worker tasks are self-contained and checkable: map or summarize part of a codebase, find every usage of something, apply a mechanical change across files, write tests against a clear spec, draft docs or boilerplate.

**Workers can see images.** DeepSeek V4.1 is multimodal and Claude Code's `Read` hands it the picture, so a brief can point at a screenshot, a mockup or a diagram and ask what is in it, or ask for two images to be compared. Say the path in the brief; the worker reads it like any other file.

**Web lookups are a standard step (delegation level 2 and up).** When a task needs outside information (versions, changelogs, API docs, an error message, prior art), send a websearch worker rather than using your own WebSearch, unless one quick search answers it. Start it as soon as the question comes up and keep working meanwhile. See "Web research and edits".

Keep for yourself: design and architecture decisions, ambiguous requirements, security-sensitive code, anything that needs this conversation's context, and anything quicker to do than to brief.

**Work in parallel as often as possible, with DeepSeek workers and Claude subagents both.** Whenever the work splits into independent parts, run the parts at once rather than one after another, and use both kinds of helper to get there: DeepSeek workers (this skill) and Claude subagents (the Agent tool). Treat them as equally capable: any task can go to either, so choose by what gets more running at once, not by how hard the task is.
- **DeepSeek workers** cost cents, so they are the first choice while the DeepSeek budget allows.
- **Claude subagents** add more lanes beside them (use `model: "sonnet"` for most work, `"haiku"` for quick lookups, the Explore agent for read-only code search), and take over the lanes DeepSeek can't fill: when the spend limit or pacing holds workers, when coders must go one at a time because of builds, or when a DeepSeek launch is refused. They draw on the user's Claude plan, which runs out too: check its pace first (see "Claude's own pace").
- **You** plan, integrate, review what comes back and keep the conversation; do your own part while the helpers run.

Never serialise work because one kind of helper is limited: add the other kind. Aim to have several helpers running whenever there is independent work, and say in each batch message what runs in parallel.

## 0. Check the tools before planning

Before you plan or delegate, check that the tools the job needs are installed: compilers, runtimes, package managers and libraries. Use this skill's checker, not `which`:

```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/ds-which.ps1" g++ cmake cargo rustc clang++ py:numpy py:PIL
```

It prints one line per tool (found with path and version, or MISSING, with the pip command for Python packages). It checks against the PATH as saved in Windows *now*. Your session inherited the PATH from when the Claude app started, so anything installed since (Rust via rustup on 2026-09-21, for example) is invisible to `which` and would be wrongly reported missing. Workers get the refreshed PATH from the launcher automatically.

**If something the best approach needs is missing, stop and ask the user to install it.** Don't start the work, pick a weaker approach, or have workers hand-write a substitute (a homemade image writer instead of Pillow, pure Python instead of numpy). Tell the user:
- what is missing and what it is for;
- the exact install command (`winget install ...`, `pip install ...`, `conda install ...`);
- what you'd do instead if they'd rather not install it, and what that costs.

Don't install it yourself unless the user says to. Go ahead without the tool only when the user chooses to. Workers follow the same rule: they report a missing tool to you instead of working around it (the launcher tells them so), and you bring it to the user.

**Done when** every tool the plan needs is installed, or you have asked the user to install what is missing and they have answered.

## 1. Write the brief

Write each brief to its own UTF-8 file in your scratchpad directory (or `$env:TEMP`). Make it complete, because the worker cannot ask questions:

```
# Goal
The outcome you want, in one or two sentences.
# Context
Relevant files and paths, conventions, decisions already made.
# Scope
Which files it may change (edit mode) and what is off-limits.
# Done when
Concrete checks the work must pass.
# Report
The exact shape of the answer you want back, e.g. findings as path:line - issue.
```

If the brief tells the worker to run commands (in backticks, e.g. `` `cargo test -p gpu` ``), give it matching `-AllowTools` rules. The launcher warns (`the brief names commands this worker may not run`) when a backticked command has no matching rule, or uses inline `python -c`, which workers can never run. Fix the rules or the brief before going on: a worker told to run something it can't will spend its turns working around it.

If the project has a glossary (`CONTEXT.md`, one per context in bigger repos), use its words in the brief and don't redefine them; if a brief keeps having to explain a term, that term belongs in the glossary.

**Keep each brief small enough to finish in well under 100 steps.** Every step re-reads everything the worker has read so far, so a run's cost grows roughly with the square of its length: 83% of DeepSeek spend is that re-reading, and the six costliest runs were coders at 236-281 steps. Two half-size tasks cost about half of one big one. Split by file or by feature, and give each worker only the files it needs.

**Done when** the brief has Goal, Context, Scope, Done when and Report; stands alone without this conversation; names no command a read-only worker cannot run; and lists the files a coder owns (or says the worker changes nothing).

## 2. Run the worker

```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/ds-agent.ps1" -TaskFile "<brief file>" -Dir "<project folder>" -Mode read
```

The same command works from both the Bash and PowerShell tools.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-Mode read` (default) | Read, Grep and Glob only |
| `-Mode edit` | Adds Edit and Write, auto-approved inside `-Dir` only |
| `-AllowTools "Bash(npm test *),Bash(git diff *)"` | Extra permission rules, comma-separated in one string; their tools are enabled too. Anything else that needs approval is denied. |
| `-AddDir "D:/ref/other-project"` | Extra folders the worker may read but never change. Use this for reference material outside the project. |
| `-DenyEdit "src/**,README.md"` | Paths inside the project that no file tool and no shell redirect may change. |
| `-Label <name>` | Names the run in `runs.csv` and in the state file. Defaults to the brief's file name. |
| `-Bare` | Faster start, no project instructions — but the worker then has `Read` only, with no Grep and no Glob. Only worth it for a one-file task. |
| `-Schema <file.json>` | A JSON Schema the final report must satisfy, when you want a result you can parse instead of prose. Works with DeepSeek. |
| `-WebDomains "docs.example.com"` | Lets the worker fetch those domains. Off by default: a web page is untrusted text, so keep it away from workers that can edit and commit. |
| `-WebEdit` | Only when the user approved it: lets a run that can read the web edit files outside an isolated worktree. See "Web research and edits". |
| `-Resume <session id>` | Continue a worker's conversation (the id is in its footer). Use the same `-Dir`, and give the follow-up with `-Task "..."` or `-TaskFile`. The run keeps its run id and messaging name, so crosstalk partners can still reach it; its report gets a `## Resume <n>` section, and the manifest counts `resumes`. |
| `-Task "<text>"` | Inline brief, for short follow-ups |
| `-Extra "<text>"` | Appended to the brief under a "This run" heading, so a standing role brief (reviewer, analyst, critic) can be pointed at today's target: `-Extra "Task: impl-006. Checkout: <path>."` |
| `-Model <id>` | DeepSeek model. Default `deepseek-flash[1m]` (V4.1 Flash with its 1M context). |
| `-Effort low\|high\|max` | How long the worker thinks before each step; default `max`. See "Effort" below. |
| `-MaxTurns 60`, `-TimeoutMinutes 30` | Limits |
| `-Kind research` | What sort of run this is (research, websearch, impl, review, analysis, critic, advisor, digest, lead, selftest, probe). Inferred from the label's prefix, including the old `t##`/`i##`/`c##` names. |
| `-Title "..."` | One line saying what the run is for. Defaults to the first line under the brief's `# Goal`. |
| `-NoCrosstalk` | Turn off crosstalk, which is **on by default**: workers can message other live workers (ListAgents, SendMessage, a wait tool). `"crosstalk": false` in `.deepseek-agents.json` turns it off for a project, and `-Crosstalk` forces it on over that. See "Crosstalk" below. |
| `-CanSpawn` | Makes the worker a DeepSeek lead that can launch its own read-only workers. See "Hierarchy" below. |
| `-SubAgents` | Gives the worker Claude Code's Agent tool; its subagents also run on DeepSeek Flash. |
| `-MaxDepth 2` | Deepest level any spawned worker may sit at; Claude's own workers are depth 1. |
| `-DryRun` | Print the command, policy, run id, lineage and environment without running |

Output is the worker's report, then a footer: `[ds-agent] run=<run id> session=<id> status=ok turns=<n> tokens_in=... tokens_out=...`. On failure, status reads `error(<reason>)`, e.g. `error(error_max_turns)`, and the report text holds the error message. A `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` line on stderr is expected, because Claude Code doesn't know DeepSeek's model names. A `denied=` entry means the worker tried a tool it was not allowed. Decide whether to rerun it with more `-AllowTools` rules or do that step yourself.

Workers often take several minutes. Run each one as a background command (`run_in_background: true`); its completion notification will interrupt whatever you are doing then. A worker's run time is your work time: see "Work while workers run".

**Name the background command for the user.** The app's Background tasks panel shows only the command's description, so write it in this fixed format, which `ds_hook.py` enforces by refusing a launch without it: `DeepSeek <kind> #<nnn>: <what it does>`, e.g. `DeepSeek impl #002: core scene + path tracer` or `DeepSeek review #007: check impl-004's BVH`. Add `(retry 2)` for a second attempt, `(resume 1)` for a resume, `(lead, spawns workers)` for `-CanSpawn`, and `(crosstalk)` when the brief has the worker talk to named siblings. Keep the whole description under about 60 characters so the panel doesn't cut it off.

**Claude subagents are named the same way, in the same numbered sequence:** `Claude <kind> #<nnn>: <what it does>`, e.g. `Claude research #185: find the door refs`, so the panel reads as one team. When Claude takes over a task briefed for DeepSeek (pacing held it, or it went to a subagent instead), keep that task's number: `Claude impl #183: field notes`. In a project that runs workers, the hook refuses an Agent call without this format and gives the corrected name, and it records every Claude subagent in the manifest beside the workers (provider `claude`, run id `<kind>-<nnn>-claude-<slug>.<attempt>`, with its model, tokens, turns, time and final report), so `ds_manifest.py --tree` and the morning report show both kinds.

When you redirect a worker's output to a file, do not name it `<stateDir>/<label>.json`: that is the launcher's own state file and it is deleted when the run ends, taking your output with it. Use another name or another folder.

While a worker runs, `<stateDir>/<label>.json` holds its `claude.exe` pid and the `taskkill` line that stops it — the worker survives its launcher being killed, so that file is how you stop a runaway. Each finished run appends a row to `<stateDir>/runs.csv` (status, turns, tokens, seconds, denied tools). `stateDir` is `local/agents` when the project has a `local/` folder, otherwise `~/.claude-deepseek/agents`.

**Done when** the launch is a background command with a panel description in the fixed format, its options match the work (mode, effort, limits, web access), and you have started your own next task rather than waiting.

## 3. Run several in parallel

Start independent workers in one message, each as its own background command. Give edit-mode workers disjoint files: two workers must never edit the same file. For large or risky edits, give each worker its own git worktree as `-Dir` and merge the results yourself.

**Parallel workers must not share build output.** Disjoint source files are not enough: in a Rust workspace every checkout gives a crate's test binary the same name, so two workers sharing one `target/` overwrote and ran each other's tests (OpenSkyrim impl-006/impl-007: an "acceptance FAIL" that was really the neighbour's binary). The harness's `tools/ds_impl.ps1` gives each task its own `target/` inside its worktree, and seeds it with a copy of the lead's `target/debug`, which takes seconds (6.6 GB in 6 s), so only the workspace's own crates rebuild (17 s instead of a cold Bevy build). `-NoSeed` starts it empty. If you launch parallel edit workers any other way, set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per worker yourself. The same applies to any build tool with one shared output folder.

The harness's tools (`ds_impl.ps1`, `ds_status.ps1`, `run_ds_queue.ps1`, `ds_report.py`, `ds_manifest.py`, `ds_delegation.py`, `check_*.py` ...) are installed in this skill's `tools/` folder (`$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/`). Run them from the project folder and they act on that project: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_impl.ps1" -Brief <brief>`. A project can also copy them into its own `tools/` unchanged: a copy acts on the project it sits in and launches workers through this skill. Diff first if the project has customised its copy.

An acceptance failure from a parallel run is not evidence until you know the build was the worker's own. Record the real cause in `pilot.csv` when you accept over a harness verdict. `python tools/ds_report.py` sums the record, and now counts denied tools by name (`5 with denied tools (Bash 5, Glob 1)`).

**Done when** each worker has its own background entry, no two can touch the same files or build output, and your own parallel work cannot collide with any of them.

## Work while workers run

Workers run for minutes; a launch that leaves you idle until the report arrives wastes most of that time. In the OpenSkyrim Blackreach demo, Claude launched three workers, did two minutes of its own work, then announced "all three workers are running" and did nothing for the remaining 3.5 minutes; later it sat through a 10-minute release build with no worker running at all. The right shape is: Claude and the workers busy at the same time, on things that cannot collide.

**Before launching, decide what you will do while they run.** When you plan a batch, split the job into the workers' parts and Claude's own part, and say both in the same message. Claude's part is work that needs this conversation or your judgement and touches nothing a worker owns:
- the next brief(s), drafted from what is already known so they are ready to launch the moment a worker's report lands (a report that changes the brief is a small edit, not a restart);
- integration plumbing for the results that are coming: the wiring, config flags, module registration and test fixtures the worker's files will plug into, in files no worker owns;
- reviewing the *previous* worker's report and diff, and spot-checking its claims;
- your own tests, builds, screenshots and measurements of already-integrated work;
- writing the design or contract for the phase after this one;
- housekeeping: handoff notes, the queue file, the manifest, commits of finished work.

**Plan four tracks, not one queue.** Before a batch, sort the work into tracks that run side by side, and say them all in the same message:
- **Coders**, limited by builds (memory, disk, a build freeze during a long conversion): as many at once as the project allows (`leadCoders`, usually one), back to back.
- **Read-only workers** (research, review, websearch, analysis): they build nothing, so memory limits and build freezes don't apply to them. Keep this track busy beside the coders with research for the next briefs and a review of each coder that lands.
- **Claude subagents** as more lanes for any of the above, and for whatever DeepSeek can't run right now (see "Work in parallel as often as possible" above).
- **Claude's own part** (the list above).

One coder at a time is not one worker at a time. When the coder track is blocked, the others keep going. In OpenSkyrim (2026-09-22..24), only one worker ran for 59% of the time any worker ran, and during a long overnight conversion every worker ran one after another, all of them coders.

**Review each coder as it lands.** When `ds_impl.ps1` reports acceptance PASS, it prints a ready review command. From delegation level 3, start that review and the next coder in the same message, and integrate after reading the review; spot-check what you integrate. The review costs cents and runs in time the next coder needs anyway, while reviewing every diff yourself costs your time and Claude tokens (OpenSkyrim: 78 coders, 8 review workers). `-Integrate` prints a short checklist first (acceptance, scope, the review verdict, pitfalls, docs) and refuses work whose last recorded acceptance failed unless you pass `-Force`.

**A question to the user doesn't park the work.** When you ask the user something, keep doing everything the answer doesn't change, and say what you're doing meanwhile. Only the work that depends on the answer waits. In OpenSkyrim, a message ending "One question is still waiting on you" was followed by 108 minutes with nothing started while a worker ran.

**Keep read-only workers out of your scratch.** A research worker with the whole project readable will read `local/impl/*` worktrees and live logs and mix them up with the real tree (stress test 2: one attributed numbers to the wrong build from file times). Put `local/**` in the project's `denyRead`, or add `-DenyEdit`-style read limits for the run, and name the exact files it should read in the brief.

**Keep apart from a running worker:** anything in a file a running worker owns; a build in a shared output folder a worker is building into (see the target/ rule above); an acceptance run of a worktree still being written. Running the game, the GPU or a physical device stays serial.

**Long commands of your own are background tasks too.** A release build, a data conversion or a test campaign that takes minutes is the same case as a worker: start it in the background, do the next thing, and let its notification bring you back. Chain the two: when the build finishes, the next worker can be briefed against it.

**When a report lands, finish your current step before switching.** The notification interrupts you; note it, complete the edit or command in hand, then review. Don't leave your own work half-done to read a report that will wait.

**Keep enough independent work queued.** A batch of three workers plus one Claude-side task is well balanced; a batch of three workers plus "watch them" is not. If you cannot think of anything safe to do while they run, that is a sign the split is wrong: either the workers have the whole job and you should give one of them the reviewer's role too, or you kept something that should have been a fourth brief.

## 4. Review before you accept

Treat every report as a draft from a junior engineer:

- Spot-check its claims by opening the cited files and lines.
- After an edit-mode run, read the full `git diff` of what the worker changed and run the tests or build.
- After integrating a worker's files, a suspiciously fast build means stale sources: the build tool thinks nothing changed. `ds_impl.ps1 -Integrate` refreshes the copied files' timestamps for this reason; if you copy files another way, touch them first.
- If the work is off, resume the same worker with specific corrections, or fix it yourself when that is faster.

Tell the user which parts DeepSeek workers did.

**Done when** every claim you are acting on has been checked against its source, every edit has been read as a diff, the tests have run on the combined result, and anything you could not verify is written down as unverified.

## Reference

The sections below are on-demand: read the one the job needs.

## Design it twice before a big brief

When the shape of a module or interface is the open question, don't brief the first design you think of. Start three `-Kind research` workers in parallel, each told to produce a **deliberately different** interface: one for the smallest surface (one to three entry points), one for the most flexible, one for the easiest call at the site that calls it most. Give each the project's own vocabulary (its CONTEXT.md, if it has one) and ask each for the interface, one usage example, what it hides, and its trade-offs. Compare them yourself, pick or combine, then write the implementation brief. Three short workers cost a few cents and a couple of minutes, and they beat committing to the first shape.

**Done when** you have three different designs, a choice, and a one-line reason for it in the brief you then write.

## Effort

DeepSeek has three thinking levels. Pick one per worker:

| `-Effort` | Use for | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | Mechanical work with an obvious method: renames, formatting, copying a pattern across files, simple lookups | Cheapest and fastest; gives up early on anything hard |
| `high` | Ordinary research, reviews and bounded code with a clear spec | Middle |
| `max` (default) | Hard reasoning: debugging, algorithms, maths, reverse engineering, anything where a wrong answer is expensive | Can think for 100k+ tokens on one step |

Measured on 2026-09-21 on a hard counting problem: `low` stopped after 24k tokens with a wrong answer, and `max` thought for 107k tokens and got it right. Workers get a 128k output cap per step (the launcher sets it; Claude Code's own default of 32k would cut a `max` answer off with nothing returned). When unsure, use `max`: DeepSeek is cheap and a wrong answer costs your review time. **For anything numeric or algorithmic, let the worker compute instead of reasoning it all out.** Allow it to write and run a script (`-Mode edit -AllowTools "Bash(python *)"`; inline `python -c` is always denied). Given only reasoning, a `max` worker on a hard counting problem spent two full 128k steps thinking and never answered. Allowed a script, it got the right answer in 12 turns and checked it three ways. `medium` and `xhigh` are still accepted for old commands, but DeepSeek runs them as `high` and `max`, and the manifest records what actually ran.

## Names and the manifest

Name briefs `<kind>-<nnn>-<slug>.md` (e.g. `research-083-console-camera.md`), with the number taken from the filesystem right before writing. The run id is `<brief name>.<attempt>`: `.1` first, and a fresh rerun of the same brief is `.2`, `.3`... A `-Resume` is not a new attempt: it keeps the run id. Never invent `t81b`-style names. The run id is also the worker's messaging name.

Each run keeps `<stateDir>/runs/<run id>/` with `brief.md`, `report.md` and `manifest.json` (kind, title, parent, lineage, state, turns, tokens including in-process subagents), and `<stateDir>/manifest.jsonl` gets `submit`, `start` and `end` lines per run (again for each resume). Failed, timed-out and cancelled runs are recorded too. The report holds every turn's final text: if a sibling's message arrives after the worker's report, the extra turn is appended under a separator instead of replacing the report. To see them:

```
python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_manifest.py" --tree        # from the project folder: Claude -> leads -> workers
python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_manifest.py" --write       # writes <stateDir>/MANIFEST.md
```

## Project policy: .deepseek-agents.json

A project can keep its worker policy in `.deepseek-agents.json` at its root, so every launch gets it without repeating flags:

```json
{
  "readOnlyDirs": ["D:/Games/Example"],
  "denyEdit": ["src/**", "AGENTS.md"],
  "denyRead": ["secrets/**"],
  "deny": ["Bash(rm *)"],
  "allowTools": "Bash(git add *),Bash(git commit *)",
  "_note": "allowTools applies to edit-mode runs only; read mode stays Read/Grep/Glob",
  "stateDir": "local/agents",
  "delegationLevel": 3,
  "defaults": { "mode": "edit", "effort": "max", "maxTurns": 400, "timeoutMinutes": 150 }
}
```

Explicit flags always beat `defaults`. Deny rules cover the file tools and the shell redirects Claude Code recognises, but not a script the worker writes and runs, so keep stating the rule in the brief as well. When a project has one, read it before writing briefs: it tells you what workers may touch. `-DryRun` prints the resolved policy.

## Crosstalk

Crosstalk is **on by default**: workers that run at the same time can message each other by run id (Claude Code's own cross-session messaging, with inbound messages set to accept). A message lands between the receiver's tool calls, and a `wait_for_messages` tool lets a worker pause for one. Workers are told to message only the siblings their brief names (and workers started by the same lead), since `ListAgents` shows every live worker on the machine, other projects' included. Claude cannot see or message workers: they live in a separate config folder so they never see your login.

For crosstalk to be useful, the brief has to set it up:
- name each sibling by run id, and say what to tell it (a finding, a changed interface, a file about to change), not just that it may talk;
- start siblings that must talk at the same time, because a finished worker can't receive;
- if a worker must receive something, say so: it then waits for the message before finishing;
- **match run lengths, or route late results through a file.** A message to a worker that has already finished is lost, and `SendMessage` still says `success` (stress test 2: 3 of 6 "ok" sends were never read). A `max` worker told to notify two `high` siblings when its fix lands can never reach them (54 min against 29 and 34; the siblings burned five-minute waits). So: give siblings that must exchange results the same effort and similar work, and for a result that lands late, name a file in both briefs (the sender writes it, the receiver reads it if the message never came). Workers are told to check `ListAgents` before an important send and to put undeliverable results in their report;
- keep shared decisions in a contract file that the messages point to;
- have every report quote any message that changed what the worker did.

Turn it off (`-NoCrosstalk`) for a worker that must not be interrupted or whose work touches nothing else running.

## Hierarchy

A worker launched with `-CanSpawn` is a DeepSeek lead. It gets `write_brief` and `spawn_workers` tools, runs up to 6 read-only workers in parallel in its folder (with crosstalk unless it turns it off), checks their reports, and returns one merged report that cites their run ids. Lineage and the depth limit are enforced by the launcher. Use a lead only for a job that splits into independent parts, and start from `templates/brief-lead.md`. **You still review:** open the child reports behind any claim you act on. For quick fan-out inside one worker, `-SubAgents` gives it the Agent tool, but its subagents get no manifest record of their own.

**A lead can start coders.** `impl-<nnn>-<slug>` briefs run through `tools/ds_impl.ps1` (at most 3 per call, in parallel), each in its own git worktree under `local/impl/<name>`, with its scope check and acceptance run. The lead reviews them and reports a verdict for each, but it cannot integrate: that stays with you. The run records show the coders under the lead. To take their work:

1. `ds_impl.ps1 -List` shows the waiting tasks.
2. Read each diff (`git -C local/impl/<name> diff`, plus new files).
3. `ds_impl.ps1 -Integrate <name>` for the ones you accept. It leaves alone any file it would copy (every file in the task's list, not just the ones the brief calls owned) that you have changed yourself since the worker started, and prints the patch command instead, because copying the whole file would throw your change away; `-Force` overrides that.
4. Run the tests on the combined result: coders never see each other's changes.

Because DeepSeek wrote these briefs, ds_impl holds them to stricter rules. Owned files must be inside the project and not protected (`denyEdit`, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, `.deepseek-agents.json`). Acceptance must be a plain test command (`cargo test`, `python -m unittest`, `npm test`, `go test`, `dotnet test` and similar, with no `;`, `|`, `&`, redirects or variables). A project can set its own list with `"leadAcceptance"` in `.deepseek-agents.json`. The acceptance still runs the coder's own tests on your machine, as it does for coders you start.

**Always show a lead's workers in the Background tasks panel. This is required for every lead.** The panel lists only commands you started, so give each of the lead's workers a watcher there. `install-skill.ps1` registers a hook (`ds_hook.py`) that enforces this: a lead launched in the foreground is refused, and once one starts you are handed the exact watcher command. `ds-watch.ps1` is in this skill's folder; run every command below from the project folder, in the background:

1. Start the lead as usual, described `DeepSeek lead #<nnn>: <what> (lead, spawns workers)`.
2. Start `ds-watch.ps1 -Children <lead task id>`, described `Watch lead #<nnn> for new workers`. It exits as soon as the lead starts workers you aren't watching yet, and prints for each one the exact `ds-watch.ps1 -Run <run id>` command and its panel description (`DeepSeek research #<nnn>.<k>: <what>`, numbered under the lead).
3. When it exits, start each printed `-Run` watcher with its printed description. If the lead is still running, start the printed `-Children ... -Known ...` command again, so later workers get entries too.
4. Each `-Run` watcher exits when its worker ends, and prints the outcome and report. Review each report as it lands; don't wait for the lead's merged report.

**Keep working while a lead runs.** Its watchers only help if you're free when they fire: a long foreground wait (a `sleep` loop, a command that polls for minutes) holds you there, and a lead's new workers get no panel entry until it ends. Wait for notifications instead.

A watcher only waits: stopping one in the panel does not stop the worker (`tools/ds_status.ps1 -Stop <label>` does). If the manifest isn't in `<project>/local/agents`, pass `-StateDir`.

## Web research and edits

**For a web lookup, use a websearch worker:** `-Kind websearch`, or a label starting `websearch-`. It has WebSearch and WebFetch on the open web (`-WebDomains` narrows it) and nothing else. It has no file tools, and it starts in an empty folder so no project instructions reach it. So a planted instruction on a page has nothing to read or change, and nothing private can leak into a query. Put everything it needs in the brief, and nothing private. It reports each claim with URLs, the number of independent sources and its confidence. A lookup takes about half a minute to two minutes, so it is capped at 30 turns and 10 minutes whatever the project defaults. Pass an explicit `-MaxTurns`/`-TimeoutMinutes` for a deliberately deep search; a lead's websearch workers always get the caps. A read-only lead, or one working in a worktree, may start websearch workers; a lead that edits the main checkout may not. Its findings are still web claims: check the ones you act on.

A web page can state something false that nobody in the run can disprove. In a probe, a lead given one plausible changelog page about an obscure package bumped the pin in `requirements.txt`, while saying itself that the claim was unverified (`docs/design/websearch-injection.md`). So the launcher treats web-sourced changes as proposals until you have checked them:

- A run that can fetch pages (`-WebDomains`, or `webDomains` in the project config), or any worker a web-reading lead starts, may edit only inside an isolated git worktree. In the main checkout the launch is refused. For one worker, use `tools/ds_impl.ps1 -WebDomains <domains>`; for a lead, `git worktree add` a checkout and point `-Dir` at it.
- Better still, split it: a read-only web lookup, then an edit run you brief yourself once you have checked the findings.
- Web-reading runs may also fetch the package registries (pypi.org, crates.io, registry.npmjs.org, api.nuget.org, proxy.golang.org), so they can check a version claim instead of trusting the page. A project's `"verifyDomains"` replaces that list.
- Their reports list every change resting on web content under **Web-sourced**, with its URL and how it was checked. Before integrating, verify each such change yourself against an authoritative source. The worker's own "unverified" label is not a review.
- Pass `-WebEdit` only when the user has approved web-sourced edits applied directly.

## Delegation level: how much to hand off

Each project has a delegation level from 1 to 5 that says how much of the work goes to workers. Check it before deciding whether to delegate: from the project folder, run `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_delegation.py" --brief`. It prints the level and its rule. The level comes from, first match wins: the `DS_DELEGATION_LEVEL` environment variable, `"delegationLevel"` in the project's `.deepseek-agents.json`, `~/.claude-deepseek/config.json`, else 3. An old 0-10 `"delegation"` value still works and is mapped (7 reads as 4). When the project's AGENTS.md has a generated "DeepSeek delegation level" block, that block is the same rule.

| Level | Rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | Only when asked. Claude does the work itself unless the user asks for a worker. |
| 2 | Research and review: delegate non-trivial research, big read-only surveys, reviews and run analyses. Claude writes all code. |
| 3 | Default. As 2, plus bounded self-contained implementation through `ds_impl.ps1` and anything that can be briefed with a clear check; parallel, with reviewers. |
| 4 | Claude manages: plans, briefs, reviews and integrates; workers explore and do most coding. Claude doesn't read source beyond what review needs; several workers busy, leads where they fit. |
| 5 | Everything: Claude only orchestrates; every task, even small edits and lookups, goes to a worker unless it needs this conversation, a GUI or the user. |

At **every** level Claude keeps the conversation with the user, design decisions, integration, security-sensitive changes, and review of every worker result it acts on. The dial moves work, not the quality bar. When the user says "use workers more" or "less", or names a number, set it with `ds_delegation.py --set <1-5> --agents-md` from the project folder (`--global` sets their default for all projects) and say what changed.

## Spend limits

The user can cap DeepSeek spend per day, per week, or both, across all their projects, like Claude's own usage limits. A worker then doesn't start when the limit is used up or when what its kind usually costs won't fit in what's left, and a running worker is stopped when the limit is reached, keeping a partial report. The launcher exits with code 4 and says why. **Don't retry a refused worker and don't work around the limit:** do the work yourself, or tell the user and let them decide. **When the user isn't there to decide (an overnight or unattended run), keep working yourself:** take the held tasks on to your usual standard, in parallel where they are independent, with Claude subagents doing the parts that don't need you, keep using the cheap read-only workers that still run, and try a coder again after the time the refusal gives. Never sit idle waiting for the pace, and never raise the limit yourself. **Unless Claude's own plan is tight too** (next section): then take on only what you can do lean, and queue the rest.

Spending is also **paced** so the limit is rarely hit: the budget is spread evenly over the day or week, plus a 20% head start. While spending runs ahead of that pace, the launcher eases off in steps and says so in its output: lower effort and a note to the worker to finish in few steps; then effort low and one worker at a time (a new worker waits for the others to finish); then no coders or leads until spending is back on pace (the refusal says when). `ds_delegation.py --brief` also reports the level one lower meanwhile; work at that level. When you see "easing off", prefer fewer, smaller briefs and do small things yourself. The same happens when the DeepSeek balance is below what the worker usually costs.

- `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/ds_spend.py" status` shows what has been spent today and this week, what is left, when it resets, and the DeepSeek balance with how long it lasts (at the last week's rate, or the limits used in full if that is lower). Check it before a big fan-out. `... ds_spend.py balance` gives only the balance. The script reads the key itself: never ask the user for it. **When the balance runs low** (under a week, or under $2), tell the user once, early, that it needs a top-up at platform.deepseek.com, and prefer cheap read-only workers meanwhile; the session-start note and the morning report say when it does.
- `... ds_spend.py set 2 --per day` (or `--per week`) sets a limit when the user asks; `... ds_spend.py off` removes it.
- `... ds_spend.py stretch 2w` (or `10d`, `36h`, `1m`, a date `2026-10-09`) when the user asks to make their credit last a while: each day's limit becomes an even share of the balance left at midnight, worked out again every day, so the credit runs out no sooner than that. `stretch off` stops it. The user can also type `/delegation` and `/spend-limit`.
- `... ds_spend.py set 1.5 --per run` caps what any one worker may cost: it is told to wrap up at 75% and stopped at the cap, keeping a partial report. A stopped worker's report says what is done; brief what is left as smaller tasks rather than relaunching the same brief. For one task that genuinely needs more, pass `-MaxCost <dollars>` to the launcher and say why.

Costs are worked out from the worker transcripts at DeepSeek's list prices, so they are estimates; the DeepSeek dashboard has the real bill. An estimate for a kind is the average of its last 20 runs.

**Step budgets and progress.** Each worker is told how many steps its kind usually takes (learned from finished runs: about 20 for a review, 45 for research, 80 for a coder) and is nudged when it runs well past that. To see how running workers are going, run `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/ds_steer.py" progress` from the project folder: one line each with time, steps against budget, tool uses, context and what it is doing now. Check it instead of reading a worker's output, and act on what it shows: a worker far past its budget or stuck on the same action is a candidate to stop and re-brief smaller. A report that says the task could not fit its budget means the brief was too big: split the rest.

## Claude's own pace

Claude's plan has limits too (a 5-hour window and a weekly one), shared by every session on the account. On 2026-09-25 the DeepSeek limit held coders overnight, the sessions did the work themselves with 35 subagents, and the account hit its 5-hour limit with the week at 83%. So pace Claude the way DeepSeek is paced, and let each budget cover for the other.

- **Read the plan** with the desktop app's get_usage tool (`mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__get_usage`; load it with ToolSearch if it is deferred) and record it: `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/ds_claude.py" record '<its JSON>'`. Do it at session start, before a fan-out of subagents or workers, and about hourly in a long or unattended run. The command prints the pace. Plan limits don't apply to an API-key session (status "not_applicable"): skip this there.
- **Follow the level it prints.** On pace: work as usual. **Lean:** new work goes to DeepSeek workers first; Claude subagents only for what a worker can't do, on smaller models for lookups. **Tight:** no new Claude subagents except short lookups, and don't take on work DeepSeek holds; queue it in the handoff. **Hold** (90% used, or far ahead of pace): only coordinate, meaning launch, review and integrate DeepSeek workers; if DeepSeek is held too, write the handoff and stop until a reset.
- **The budgets lean on each other.** While Claude is tight, DeepSeek's pacing allows it further ahead (its limits never move), so hand it more. While DeepSeek is held, do the work yourself, unless Claude is tight too; then do only the small parts and queue the rest.
- **Keep your own context small.** Every turn re-reads the whole conversation, so a 700k-token session costs about ten times more a turn than a fresh one. Hand big reading to workers. When a session has grown large, suggest the user runs `/compact` at a quiet moment: nothing mid-edit, and no running worker whose finish notice this session must receive. Don't suggest a new session instead: a fresh session misses those notices, and users may prefer to keep one session. Beforehand, make sure the state is in files that survive compaction (the handoff, the team log, or `local/handover-<date>.md`).

The hook repeats the pace at session start, and after subagent calls and shell commands at most every half hour when it is off pace, or the reading is missing or over an hour old. It also says when this session's context passes 400k tokens.

## Project memory, nudges and the morning report

**Project memory.** Two short files in the project's state folder go into every worker's brief, so it doesn't explore from scratch: a **map** (layout, entry points, key types, build and test commands, traps) for every kind except websearch, and **pitfalls** (mistakes workers made here before, as rules) for coders, leads and reviewers. Both are written by cheap digest workers (a few cents each). **Keeping them current is always your job, at every delegation level from 2:** at the start of a session, and whenever the morning report says memory is due, run `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_memory.py" due` from the project folder and start every command it prints, in the background, before planning other worker launches. It briefs a map when there is none or it is 40+ commits or two weeks behind, and pitfalls once 5 reviews have come in since the last update (3 for a first list); the launcher saves each when it ends. `... ds_memory.py status` shows how old each is.
- When you reject or fix a worker's work yourself, add the lesson at once, for free: `... ds_memory.py note "<a rule a coder can follow>"`.

**Standing audits.** Instead of writing a fresh review brief each time, each important area of the project can have a standing checklist (`memory/checklists/<area>.md`): the invariants a change there must keep, each anchored on real symbols with the test that guards it, plus a security section. `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_audit.py" init` briefs a digest worker to propose the areas and first checklists (the launcher saves them). After that, `... ds_audit.py due` briefs an audit only for the areas whose code changed since their last audit, and prints the commands: run them in the background like any review. Each audit files what it confirms as numbered findings (`ESM-20260925-03`) that stay open until a later audit reports them fixed or you run `... ds_audit.py close <id>`, and adds new invariants it discovers to the checklist. `... ds_audit.py findings` lists what's open; brief coders from it. Run `due` when the morning report says audits are due, and before a release. For numbers that should only change on purpose (records parsed, cells converted, test counts), `... ds_audit.py baseline record <name> -- <command>` keeps the command's output, and `baseline check <name>` shows what moved.

**Nudges.** The launcher watches each running worker and, the first time it drifts, tells it so after its next tool call: at 100, 150 and 200 steps; at 200k and 350k tokens of context; when the same command form is refused three times; and when it sleeps for minutes. The launcher prints `nudged the worker: <what>`. A nudged worker is told to wrap up and report what is done and what is left, so expect a shorter report with a list of what remains, and brief the rest as new, smaller tasks.

**Morning report.** When a session starts in a project where workers ran since the last report, you get a few lines as context: what failed or got stuck, long runs, time spent sleeping, spend against the limit, and whether the memory is due. Read the full report (its path is given) before planning, act on what needs attention, and mention anything the user should know. `python "$HOME/.claude/skills/deepseek-agents/tools/ds_morning.py"` gives the full report at any time.

## Working with the Matt Pocock skills

When the `mattpocock-skills` plugin is installed, every step in it that says "sub-agent" or "background agent" is a DeepSeek worker's job from delegation level 2 up. Their skills stay as written; you supply the workers.

| Their step | Give it to |
|---|---|
| `research`: "spin up a background agent to do the research" | `-Kind websearch` for the open web, `-Kind research` for the repo. Keep their output convention: one Markdown file where the repo already keeps notes, every claim cited. The worker reports to you; you write the file. |
| `code-review`: the Standards and Spec sub-agents | Two `-Kind review` workers in parallel, one per axis. Paste the 12-smell baseline into the Standards brief in full (the worker has no other access to it), hold both briefs to the skill's 400 words, and report the axes separately: no merging, no reranking. |
| `codebase-design`: Design It Twice, "3+ sub-agents in parallel" | Three or four `-Kind research` workers, one constraint each (smallest interface, most flexible, best for the common caller, ports and adapters), with the project's CONTEXT.md vocabulary in every brief. |
| `improve-codebase-architecture`: "spawn a sub-agent to walk the codebase" | One `-Kind research` worker for the friction walk. Its HTML report stays out of the repo, in the temp folder. |
| `grilling`: "dispatch a sub-agent to find" a fact | One `-Kind websearch` worker, and carry on with the round while it runs. |
| `to-tickets` / `wayfinder`: tickets marked `ready-for-agent` | One coder per ticket through `tools/ds_impl.ps1`: owned files from the ticket, acceptance from its test command. |
| `tdd`: one red-green slice | A coder per slice, at seams the user has confirmed. Refactoring belongs to review, not the loop. |

Keep for yourself: `diagnosing-bugs` phases 1 and 2, because workers have no shell and cannot build or run a reproduction loop (once you have one, an `-Kind analysis` worker can read the captured output); `domain-modeling`, which edits CONTEXT.md and ADRs; and every decision their skills route to the user.

Preserve their conventions when a worker's output lands in the repo: CONTEXT.md is a glossary and nothing else, ADRs go to `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`, research notes are one cited Markdown file, and architecture reports go to the temp folder.

## Setup and errors

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is not set`: ask the user to run this in their own PowerShell window. Never ask them to paste the key into the chat.
  `$k = Read-Host 'DeepSeek API key' -AsSecureString; [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('DEEPSEEK_API_KEY', [Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $k).Password, 'User')`
  The script reads the saved variable directly, so nothing needs restarting.
- `Claude Code was not found`: the user needs the Claude Code CLI or the Claude desktop app installed, or `DEEPSEEK_AGENT_CLAUDE` set to the full path of `claude.exe`.
- An authentication error (401) comes from DeepSeek and means the key is wrong. A 402 means the DeepSeek account has run out of balance.
