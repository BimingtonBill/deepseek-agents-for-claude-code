#   2. "stateDir" in <Dir>\.deepseek-agents.json - absolute used as-is, otherwise joined onto <Dir>. A
#      missing or unreadable file, bad JSON, or a missing or empty key falls through;
#   3. <Dir>\local\agents, when <Dir>\local is an existing folder;

# Prints one line - that folder, absolute, with no trailing separator - and nothing else. It creates
# nothing, never fails on a missing or malformed config, and always exits 0.
