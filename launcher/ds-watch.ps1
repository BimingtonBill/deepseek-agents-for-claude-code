.SYNOPSIS
  Waits on DeepSeek runs so each one can appear as its own entry in the Claude app's Background tasks
  panel, including the workers a DeepSeek lead starts itself.

.DESCRIPTION
  The panel lists only commands the Claude session started, and a lead's workers are started by the
  lead, not by Claude. So Claude starts one of these per run, as a background command:

    -Children <lead>  waits until the lead has started workers not listed in -Known (or the lead has
                      ended), prints each new worker with the command and panel description to watch it,
                      then exits. That exit is Claude's signal. Start it again with the grown -Known list
                      while the lead is still running.
    -Run <run>        waits until that run ends, then prints its state, turns, tokens and report.

  <lead> and <run> are run ids (research-003-x.1) or task ids (research-003-x, meaning its newest
  attempt). Runs are read from the manifest: -StateDir, else the launcher's state-dir rule
  (launcher/ds-state.ps1): DS_STATE_DIR, the current folder's "stateDir", then <current
  folder>\local\agents, then the shared ~\.claude-deepseek\agents. Stopping a watcher does not stop the
  worker; use tools/ds_status.ps1 -Stop <label> for that.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ds-watch.ps1 -Children lead-001-project-audit
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ds-watch.ps1 -Run research-001-2-combat.1
