"""DeepSeek spend limits, per day and per week, the way Claude's usage limits work: a worker does not
start when the limit is used up or when what it usually costs would not fit, and a running worker is
stopped when the limit is reached. The limit resets at local midnight (day) or Monday midnight (week;
set --from-now counts only spending from that moment and starts each week on that weekday).

Spending is also paced, so the limit is rarely reached at all. The budget is spread evenly over the day
or week, plus a head start of 20% of the limit. While spending stays within that pace, nothing changes.
When it runs ahead, workers ease off in steps (see EASE):
  1. lower effort (max becomes high), a note to finish in few steps, delegation one level down;
  2. effort low, and one worker at a time (a new one waits for others to finish, up to 20 minutes);
  3. as 2, and no coders or leads until spending is back on pace.
While Claude's own plan is tight (ds_claude.py, level 2 or more), the head start grows by
CLAUDE_TIGHT_HEAD, so DeepSeek takes more of the work; the limits themselves never move.

    python ds_spend.py status                  what has been spent, what is left, when it resets
    python ds_spend.py set 2 --per day         limit DeepSeek spend to $2 a day (--per week for a week,
                                               --from-now to ignore what was spent before now)
    python ds_spend.py set 1.5 --per run       stop any one worker once it has cost $1.50 (a nudge to wrap
                                               up comes first, at 75%); ds-agent.ps1 -MaxCost overrides it
    python ds_spend.py stretch 2w              make the DeepSeek credit last two weeks (also 10d, 36h, 1m, or a
                                               date: 2026-10-09); `stretch off` stops it
    python ds_spend.py off [--per day|week|run|stretch]  remove a limit (all of them when --per is left out)
    python ds_spend.py backfill <project> ...  add past runs from those projects to the spend record

ds-agent.ps1 calls the rest itself: check (before a worker starts), live (every 15 seconds while it
runs) and record (when it ends). Everything lives in one folder shared by every project, so a limit
covers all of them: DS_SPEND_DIR, else ~/.claude-deepseek/spend. It holds limits.json, spend.jsonl (one
line per finished run) and live/ (what each running worker has spent so far).

Costs are worked out from the token counts in each worker's transcript at DeepSeek's list prices
(PRICE below; override with "prices" in limits.json). They come out higher than the DeepSeek dashboard
(roughly a third higher in the one comparison made, 2026-09-24), so limits act a little early; the
dashboard is the real bill.

The DeepSeek balance: the launcher fetches it before every worker and passes it to `check`, which keeps
the latest in balance.json. `status` and `balance` fetch it fresh (the key is read from DEEPSEEK_API_KEY,
this process's or the saved user variable, and never printed), and say how long it lasts at the last
week's rate of spending. The morning report and the SessionStart hook use the saved value, and warn
when it runs low.
