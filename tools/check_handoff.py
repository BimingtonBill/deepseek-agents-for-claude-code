"""Check a worker's handoff note for the things the lead builds on.

Every worker leaves `docs/handoff/<task>.md` and the lead reads it instead of the worker's
transcript, so a note that reads finished but never says what was tested - or cites a file
that is not there - is worse than none: it looks done. This checks the mechanical half of
that. A sound note says what was verified and what was not, a claim of testing has a
command, a log line, a round number or a file behind it, no placeholder was left in, and
every `path:line` resolves. The last is `tools/check_citations.py`, imported rather than
repeated, and its findings are reported here as they come.

  python tools/check_handoff.py docs/handoff/t53-menu-open-cost.md
  python tools/check_handoff.py --all                # every note in docs/handoff
  python tools/check_handoff.py --all --quiet        # problems only

Exit code 1 when a note has a problem, 0 when none does. The two answers are kept apart: a
*problem* is a line the note has to answer for, and a *note* is a judgement the lead may
overrule and never changes the exit code. check_handoff and check_all return problems
alone, so `if check_handoff(path)` says the note is faulty; check_handoff_notes returns the
judgements, which the CLI prints prefixed "note: ".

The rules are deliberately lenient, because a rule that fires on a good note trains the
lead to ignore the tool. The notes in docs/handoff are the specification, they vary, and
substance decides rather than headings: "verified", "not tested", "open", "could not",
"inferred" count wherever they sit, in a heading or in half a sentence. Six shapes that
look like problems from the brief are not:

  * "..." is a placeholder only when it is the whole of a line, or of a table cell, of the
    note's own writing. `.../827c69d0.asm.txt:1465` is a citation with its folder
    abbreviated, `[A] OK [B] Back ...` is a list that stops - and a log line quoted in a
    fence prints `...` of its own accord (t07:73).
  * a bare file name that several files in the repository answer to is a citation to check
    by hand, not a broken one - tools/check_citations.py's own distinction, kept here.
  * a claim of testing is looked for in the prose only: a log line quoted in a fence is
    evidence, not a claim.
  * `local/` and `logs/` are Git-ignored, so a checkout made from a commit carries neither.
    There, a citation that cannot resolve - into those trees, or a bare file name, which
    the incomplete index cannot place - is reported as a note with a reason, not as a
    problem its author could act on. In the working copy, where both trees exist, every
    such citation is checked and broken ones are problems, as they should be.
  * a citation whose path writes a folder as "..." is a note in either checkout, because
    neither can resolve it: `local/pc/.../__Packages/OptionsMenu.as:276` (t02:136, t13:91,
    t44:17) abbreviates a folder the note does not name, and check_citations cannot see the
    leading form at all (`.../827c69d0.asm.txt:1465`). Reporting it as a problem would make
    the same citation a fault where local/ is on disk and a note where it is not.
  * a heading with nothing under it is a note, not a problem; some notes leave a heading
    where a section moved elsewhere.
