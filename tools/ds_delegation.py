"""The delegation level: how much Claude hands to DeepSeek workers, from 1 (only when asked) to 5 (everything).

    python tools/ds_delegation.py                     the effective level here, where it comes from, and what it means
    python tools/ds_delegation.py --set 4             set it for this project (.deepseek-agents.json "delegationLevel")
    python tools/ds_delegation.py --set 3 --global    set your default for every project (~/.claude-deepseek/config.json)
    python tools/ds_delegation.py --set 4 --agents-md also write the level's rules into this project's AGENTS.md
    python tools/ds_delegation.py --table             all five levels

Where the level comes from, first match wins: the DS_DELEGATION_LEVEL environment variable, the project's
.deepseek-agents.json, ~/.claude-deepseek/config.json, else 3.

The scale used to run from 0 to 10, stored as "delegation" (and DS_DELEGATION). Those still work: when
no 1-5 value is set at the same place, an old value is read and mapped (0-2 -> 1, 3-4 -> 2, 5-6 -> 3,
7-8 -> 4, 9-10 -> 5). --set writes the new key and drops the old one.

The level steers Claude, not the workers, so Claude has to see it. The deepseek-agents skill reads it,
but the skill only loads when workers come up. --agents-md puts the rules in the project's AGENTS.md,
which Claude reads at the start of every session; without it, levels above 3 can't make Claude reach
for workers unprompted.
