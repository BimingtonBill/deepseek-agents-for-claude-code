Delegating is worth it only if it reduces the lead's total work, so the report answers one
question per task type: how much came back accepted without correction, what the worker cost
in minutes and tokens, and what the lead then spent on it. Lead effort that was never
recorded is unknown, and the report says so instead of counting it as zero - a total that
quietly assumed zero would make delegation look free. A value projected from a partial record
is marked with a leading '~'.
